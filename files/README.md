In the `find-the-error.zip` file you see the output of a machine for every day between 2000-01-01 and 2021-12-31.
If everything works fine, the machine prints the numbers from 1 to 100, one per line. 
On one day the machine malfunctioned and the numbers were not printed on separate lines.
Find the date on which that problem occured.
